## Setup Site configuration

<Steps>

### Add SEO friendly title and description

Your site’s title and meta description are the first things people see when your site appears on search engines like Google. Adding SEO-friendly content here helps attract clicks and improves your visibility.

- **Name:** Optionally, update your brand name.

- **Title:** This appears as the main heading in search results and browser tabs. Keep it concise, clear, and relevant to your product.

- **Description:** This summary shows up below the title in search results. Aim for 150–160 characters that explain what your site or platform offers.

### Customize the Brand color, and Upload the Logo and Favicon

Your brand is how users recognize and trust your platform. In this step, you can personalize Torqbit to reflect your company’s identity.

- **Accent Color:** Select your primary color to match your brand style.

- **Square logo:** This is the logo shown in the login page, communication emails and browser tab. Upload a square image (usually 60x60 px) to match your branding.

- **Long Logo:** Upload your brand’s logo to be shown on the platform's header. Upload a rectangular image (preferably 600 x 72 px). If you want to support both light and dark
  theme, then make sure to upload the long logo for both the themes.

- **Socials:** Let your users connect with you on different social networking platform, to let them understand more about your brand
