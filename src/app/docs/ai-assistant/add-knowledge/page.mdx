Your AI assistant needs all the information to answer queries about your product and services. Follow the below steps
to feed it with different knowledge sources

### Add a single web page

You can add a single link to the knowledge base, and Torqbit will go ahead and extract the content and add to the vector database.

- Click on the **AI Assistant > Add a Source**, and you will be presented with the three options -- Single link, Sitemap and Docs website

- Choose the single link, and add the url of a web page and click on **Add Link**

- You will be presented with a list of links, that you can choose to add to the knowledge source of the AI assistant

- Once you've chosen the link, click on **Add links** to extract the content and save it to the knowledge source
